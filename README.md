# 🌐 Web Development Projects

Welcome to my curated collection of web development projects — built from scratch during my journey of learning full-stack development. This repo consolidates everything from beginner experiments to more advanced builds, all organized for clarity and growth tracking.

## 🚀 Why This Repo?

Instead of scattering projects across multiple repositories, I've brought them together here to:
- Maintain a consistent GitHub contribution streak 📈
- Showcase my evolving skillset in one place
- Make it easier for recruiters and collaborators to explore my work
